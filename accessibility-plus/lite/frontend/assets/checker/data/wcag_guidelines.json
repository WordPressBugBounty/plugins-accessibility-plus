Check for Horizontal Scrolling: In this narrow view or zoomed-in state:\n  i. Read through the main text content. Do you need to scroll horizontally (left\/right) to read full lines of text?\n  ii. Look at buttons, links, and form fields. Can you see and use them without scrolling horizontally?\n 3. Identify Exceptions: Note any content that inherently requires two dimensions (maps, data tables, specific diagrams). Is horizontal scrolling only confined to these specific components, while the rest of the page reflows?\n 4. Evaluate:\n  - Pass: All content reflows to fit the narrow width (e.g., into a single column). No horizontal scrolling is needed to read text or use controls, except potentially within specific components like maps or data tables.\n  - Fail: You need to scroll horizontally back and forth to read lines of text or access controls that aren't part of an excepted component type."

The check fails if the site's CSS forces colors using !important or uses background images that prevent user color selection for text blocks.

Use visual estimation or copy-paste a line into a character counter. Excessively wide blocks fail. CSS like max-width: 70ch; helps meet this.\n 3. Check Text Alignment (No Justification):\n  - Look at paragraph alignment.\n  - Check: Is the text fully justified (aligned to both left and right margins)? Full justification fails. Left (or right for RTL) alignment passes.\n 4. Check Spacing (Line and Paragraph):\n  - Use browser developer tools to inspect the CSS for blocks of text.\n  - Check Line Spacing: Is the line-height property at least 1.5 (or equivalent, like 150%)?\n  - Check Paragraph Spacing: Is the space between paragraphs (e.g., margin-bottom or margin-top) at least 1.5 times the line-height value?

      "how_to_test":"1. Navigate with Keyboard: Use the Tab key to move focus to various interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, custom controls, menu items, etc.).\n 2. Assess Indicator Size:\n  - Look at the focus indicator that appears. Does it look reasonably substantial?\n  - Verification: The simplest way to pass is using a solid outline that is at least 2 CSS pixels thick. If a different style is used (e.g., background change, thicker underline), you'd technically need to calculate if its area meets the \"2px perimeter\" rule, which is complex. For manual checks, look for indicators that are clearly visible and substantial \u2013 a 1px dotted line likely fails, while a 2px solid outline likely passes the size check.\n 3. Assess Contrast Change:\n  - Use browser developer tools (\"Inspect\") to identify the color values involved.\n  - Compare Focused vs. Unfocused: You need to compare the color of the pixels making up the focus indicator when focused with the color of those exact same pixels when the element is not focused.\n  - Use Contrast Tool: Use a color contrast analyzer to check the ratio between these two colors (focused state pixel vs. unfocused state pixel).\n  - Check Ratio: Is the contrast ratio at least 3:1? This must apply to an area of the indicator that meets the minimum size requirement (from step 2). For example, if a 2px blue outline appears on a white background, the change is white (#FFF) to blue (#00F), which has high contrast. If a button changes from light gray to slightly darker gray, the contrast change might be less than 3:1 and fail.\n 4. Check Exceptions: Does the site appear to be using unmodified browser default focus indicators and has it not modified the adjacent background colors in a way that reduces the indicator's visibility? If yes, the check passes due to the exception. If the author has customized the indicator (outline, border, background-color on focus) or its adjacent background, the size and contrast change rules must be met.\n 5. Evaluate: The check fails if the focus indicator does not meet both the minimum size requirement AND the minimum 3:1 contrast change requirement (unless the user agent default exception applies)."

Test Submission Process: For each form, fill it out and proceed to submit it.\n 3. Check for Prevention Mechanisms: Before or immediately after submitting, verify if at least one of these exists:\n  - Reversible: After submission, is there an immediate and obvious way to undo or retract it (e.g., a \"Delete My Comment\" button appears next to the posted comment; a \"Revert Settings\" option)?\n  - Checked: Before final submission, does the form check for input errors (like required fields, correct format) and allow you to correct them? (Relates to SC 3.3.1\/3.3.3).\n  - Confirm: Is there a review step before the final submission where you can check your input and confirm you want to proceed? (e.g., \"Preview your comment before posting?\").\n 4. Evaluate:\n  - Pass: Every form submission process includes at least one of the three mechanisms (Reversible, Checked, or Confirmed).\n  - Fail: Any form allows submission without offering at least one of these error prevention safeguards."

      "layman_description":"Imagine you're filling out a form online. Sometimes, the website will tell you if something went right or wrong, like \"Your password has been updated!\" or \"That username is already taken.\" This rule is about making sure those messages are announced to people who can't see the screen, such as blind people using screen readers. If the messages aren't announced, they won't know what's happening and might get stuck or confused.",
      "how_to_test":"1. Identify Actions Triggering Status Messages: Find actions on the site that display brief feedback messages without interrupting you. Examples:\n  - Adding an item to a cart\/wishlist.\n  - Submitting a simple form (like newsletter signup) that updates on the same page.\n  - Applying filters that dynamically update results.\n  - Saving settings.\n  - Actions that might show brief success, progress, or error notifications.\n 2. Use a Screen Reader (Recommended):\n  - Turn on a screen reader (like NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).\n  - Perform the action identified in Step 1. Keep your keyboard focus on the control you activated (e.g., the \"Add to Cart\" button).\n  - Listen: Does the screen reader automatically announce the status message (e.g., \"Item added to cart\") shortly after you perform the action, even though your focus didn't move to the message itself?\n 3. Inspect the Code (Alternative\/Confirmation):\n  - Perform the action to make the status message appear visually.\n  - Use browser developer tools (\"Inspect Element\") to examine the HTML element containing the status message text.\n  - Check: Does the message container (or a parent) have an appropriate ARIA live region attribute? Look for:\n  => role=\"status\" (for general updates, implicitly aria-live=\"polite\")\n  => role=\"alert\" (for important errors\/warnings, implicitly aria-live=\"assertive\")\n  => aria-live=\"polite\" (announces when user is idle)\n  => aria-live=\"assertive\" (interrupts to announce immediately)\n  => Other roles like log or progressbar might also imply live regions.\n 4. Evaluate:\n  - Pass: Status messages that appear visually are also automatically announced by screen readers (or have the appropriate ARIA live region attributes in the code).\n  - Fail: Status messages appear visually but are not announced by screen readers because they lack the necessary ARIA live region markup (role=\"status\", role=\"alert\", aria-live, etc.)."
