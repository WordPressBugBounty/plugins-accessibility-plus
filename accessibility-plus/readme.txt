Powerful WordPress accessibility plugin to detect and fix WCAG issues, improve usability, and support ADA, EAA, and Section 508 compliance.


==Description==
Accessibility Tool kit is a powerful WordPress accessibility plugin that helps make your entire WordPress site compliant with a11y standards, including **WCAG 2.1** level A and AA, **Section 508**, and **ARIA** guidelines.


The plugin helps you detect and address common accessibility issues on your WordPress website, from missing labels to improper heading structure and keyboard navigation traps.


Accessibility Toolkit is ideal for site administrators, developers, and agencies seeking to **create more inclusive and user-friendly websites**.

**See our detailed [guide to set up the WordPress Accessibility tool](https://www.webyes.com/documentation/wordpress-accessibility-toolkit-plugin-setup/).**

**Disclaimer:** Accessibility Toolkit helps identify and address many common accessibility issues. However, it **does not guarantee complete compliance** with WCAG, ADA, or other accessibility laws and regulations. Additionally, some requirements, such as writing accurate image alt text, ensuring link purpose clarity, and maintaining proper heading/content hierarchy, still require **manual review and human judgment**.

For full legal compliance, we recommend conducting a comprehensive accessibility audit and remediation process.

### More than an Accessibility Widget or an Overlay Widget
Accessibility Tool Kit is not an accessibility widget or an overlay. The plugin aims to remediate accessibility issues and fix barriers at the code level without compromising the performance of the website. 
The plugin does not add JavaScript to modify how people with disabilities and users of assistive technologies interact with your website. Instead, this web accessibility WordPress plugin helps you:

* Improve **WordPress accessibility compliance without needing to code**
* Strengthen **screen reader accessibility** with better markup and ARIA attributes
* Ensure  more **accessible links and forms** sitewide
* Make your site usable for **keyboard-only navigation**
* Provide **mobile zoom and readability** enhancements for on-the-go visitors
* Show commitment to inclusivity, build user trust, and support legal compliance with an **accessibility statement**.
* Test website accessibility and give more control to users on how they choose to view the website with **Accessibility Toolbar**.

Accessibility Tool Kit, coupled with accessibility tester and validator tools like [WebYes](https://www.webyes.com/accessibility-checker/), can help identify accessibility issues and provide guidance on how to fix them.
###Accessibility Tool Kit Features for your WordPress Web Accessibility Goals
Website accessibility is crucial because around 15% of the world’s population, approximately 1 billion people, live with some form of disability. Ensuring your website is accessible and compliant with standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) level A, AA, and AAA, and legal frameworks such as the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the EAA (European Accessibility Act) creates an inclusive experience for people with diverse needs.

Below are the core features of the plugin that will help you reach your WordPress website accessibility goals:

* **Accessibility Checker** - adds a front-end scanning widget to identify potential accessibility issues on your WordPress site. The checker detects WCAG violations such as missing labels, poor contrast, or improper heading structure, helping you understand where improvements are needed.
* **Issue Fixes** - dynamically add code-level fixes to your website. 
* **Accessibility toolbar** - to help users with disability make necessary adjustments on your website to meet their unique accessibility needs.
* **Accessibility Statement Generator** - easily generate and add an accessibility statement to your website per various laws, like the European Accessibility Act (EAA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

==  Accessibility Checker for WordPress ==
The WordPress Accessibility Checker feature adds a front-end scanning widget that allows administrators to identify potential accessibility issues directly on the website.
Key Highlights:

* Adds a **front-end scanning widget** visible only to administrators.
* Detects **WCAG violations** such as missing alt text, low color contrast, improper heading hierarchy, and unlabeled form fields.
* Provides **on-page visual indicators** to pinpoint accessibility issues directly within the site layout.
* Displays a **summary of detected issues** in an easy-to-read panel for quick reference.
* Does **not modify or overlay your website’s content** or design; instead, it analyzes the underlying code to identify areas that need attention.

== Dynamic Issue Fixes == 

This includes the following features that guide you towards the first steps in accessibility remediation. 

* **Improved readability** - ensures screen readers interpret text and language correctly.
* **Logical keyboard navigation** - maintains natural tab flow and focus throughout the page.
* **Skip to content** - lets users jump straight to the main content using the keyboard.
* **Visible focus indicators**- highlight the active element clearly during keyboard use.
* **Clear and meaningful labels** - adds helpful names to elements for better screen reader support.
* **Mobile-friendly zoom** - allows users to zoom on mobile without breaking the layout.
* **Accessible links** - make links stand out clearly and visibly without relying on color.
* **Predictable link behaviour** - avoids unexpected new tabs or windows.
* **Link opening notices** - alerts users when a link opens in a new tab or window.
* **Labelled form fields** - ensures every input field has a proper label for accessibility.
* **Accessible search fields** - adds clear labels to search bars for easier use.


==Accessibility Toolbar ==
Accessibility Toolbar is an interactive widget designed to make your site more inclusive and user-friendly.

With this toolbar, website admins can give visitors more control over their browsing experience. The toolbar appears as a small, customizable widget on the front end of your website and offers several helpful tools:

* **Adjustable Font Size:** Users can increase or decrease text size across your site for better readability.
* **Color Contrast Options:** Switch between different color contrast modes to improve visibility and accessibility. This will also help you quickly test how the site performs under different visual conditions, particularly for users with low vision or color blindness.
* **Greyscale Mode:** View your website in greyscale to test visual contrast and ensure elements are **color independent**.

Admins can use this feature to let visitors personalize how they view content on their website.

== Accessibility Statement Generator ==

An accessibility statement is a public declaration of your website’s commitment to accessibility.  
It informs visitors about the steps you have taken to make your content accessible and what measures are in place to support users with disabilities.

With this feature, you can:

* **Quickly create and publish an accessibility statement** on your site
* **Demonstrate transparency and inclusivity** to your audience
* **Show compliance with legal frameworks** like the ADA, Section 508, and the European Accessibility Act (EAA)
* **Build trust with users** by clearly communicating your accessibility efforts

Publishing an accessibility statement not only improves user confidence but also helps reduce the risk of legal complaints by showing that you are actively working toward compliance.

= Does it support custom themes and builders?=
Yes. Accessibility Toolkit works with most themes and builders like Elementor, WPBakery, and Block Editor. Some deeply customised elements may require manual integration.
=Will Accessibility Toolkit make my website fully compliant with accessibility laws?=
**Accessibility Toolkit** is designed to help your website align with key accessibility standards such as **WCAG**, **ADA**, **EAA**, and **EN 301 549**. While it significantly improves accessibility and supports compliance efforts, it does **not guarantee full legal compliance** on its own. For complete compliance, a thorough **accessibility audit and manual remediation** may still be necessary.
=Does the plugin modify the site’s content?=
No. It enhances existing markup with JavaScript and hooks, keeping your database content unchanged unless you choose to apply permanent fixes.

No. Accessibility Toolkit works out of the box with default settings, and you can enable or disable features with simple toggles in the admin panel **no coding required**.
= Does the plugin work with screen readers?=
Yes. Accessibility Toolkit improves semantic structure and ARIA attributes so your content can be properly interpreted by screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
=Can Accessibility Toolkit fix all accessibility issues automatically?=
While Accessibility Toolkit automates many fixes, **some issues still require manual review**, such as writing meaningful alt text or structuring content. Think of it as a powerful toolkit, not a one-click solution.
=Will it slow down my website?=
No. Accessibility Toolkit is **lightweight and optimised** for performance. It runs efficiently alongside your existing plugins and themes.
=Can the plugin do an accessibility scan for finding accessibility barriers on a website=
No, the plugin does not perform any automated scans or automated reviews on the website to identify the issues as per WCAG.
